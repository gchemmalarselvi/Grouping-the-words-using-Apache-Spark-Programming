The rates of new coronavirus infections are higher than they have been since January. Hospitalizations are also at their highest levels since January. In many parts of the United States, both infections and hospitalizations are higher than they were during Labor Day weekend in 2020.How should people think about Covid-19 safety now, compared to last year? Is it safe to see family and friends? What if extended family members want to stay in a house together -- what are some steps they should take to reduce risk? And how does the start of school affect our risk?To help navigate these questions, we spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr.Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She\\'s also author of a new book, \"Lifelines: A Doctor\\'s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.Things are very different this Labor Day compared to last year for one main reason. We have vaccines that are safe and protect very well against severe Covid-19 disease.

The rates of new coronavirus infections are higher than they have been since January. Hospitalizations are also at their highest levels since January. In many parts of the United States, both infections and hospitalizations are higher than they were during Labor Day weekend in 2020.How should people think about Covid-19 safety now, compared to last year? Is it safe to see family and friends? What if extended family members want to stay in a house together -- what are some steps they should take to reduce risk? And how does the start of school affect our risk?To help navigate these questions, we spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr.Leana Wen.
